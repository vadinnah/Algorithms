## Graph

### Section Structure

This section is divided into three major sections. The first sections defines graphs and their properties. The second section introduces the types of problems surrounding graphs. 

The third section explores the algorithms that solve the different graph problems. The exploration includes
* defining how to algorithm works
* the algorithms properties (limitations, sub problems they solve)

### Graphs: What are they?

A graph can be:
* **Cyclic** (has cycles) or **Acyclic** (doesn't have cycles)
* **Directed** (edges are unidirectional) or **Undirected** (edges are bidirectional)
* **Weighted** (edges have varying weights) or **Unweighted** (all edges have the same weight).
* **Sparse** (the number of edges, E, is much less than the numbers of vertices squared, E < V^2) or **Dense** (the number of edges, E, is close to the numbers of vertices squared, E ~ V^2)

### Graphs Problems

* single-source shortest path
* any-source shortest path
* minimum spanning tree
* Detecting cycles
* topological sort
