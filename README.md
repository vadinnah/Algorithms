## Graph

### Section Structure

This section is divided into two main sections. The first sections defines graphs, their properties and the types of problems surrounding graphs. 

The second section explores the algorithms that solve the different graph problems. The exploration includes
* defining how to algorithm works
* the algorithms properties (limitations, sub problems they solve)
